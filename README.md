An Android RAT that written in completely C# by me (qH0sT a.k.a Sagopa K)  

Yes, It is supporting dns connection like no-ip or duckdns or dynu......  

I'm very busy; I can't answer immediately for your issue.  

DON'T USE WITH MULTIPLE CLIENTS, THERE IS SOCKET BASED BUG, I HAVE FIXED THIS BUG AND WILL RELEASE NEW UPDATE SOON. And dont open builder error issue, I will wifx this.  

Connection may will not coming if device is in sleep(doze) mode in currently update but I will fix this.  

+How can I build a Client?

Don't worry, there is no complicated ``Socket`` programming; all thing is simple to understand.  

-You must also UDP port open; select item in comboBox on NAT page of Modem: TCP and UDP (both) , otherwise you can't hear live microphone.  

-Delete all files and folders in the path on SV project (SV\bin\Debug\resources\ProjectFolder\) and re-copy the Client files into the this path.  

For Keylogger your victim must toggle on Accessibility button of your trojan in Settings of Device
